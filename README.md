# IMPROVING-THE-DETECTION-OF-SUICIDE-INTENT-AND-DEPRESSION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING



Suicide ideation detection in text or utilising natural language processing techniques is a new research area with many challenges.
According to new research, publicly available material published across social media platforms can be used to identify people who are considering suicide. 
Suicide prevention is hampered by a lack of understanding and detection of the multiple risk factors and warning signs that might lead to suicide.
In this study, Reddit was employed as an inconspicuous data source for gleaning information about suicidal tendencies, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a subtype of recurrent neural networks, was used to predict suicide risk.
